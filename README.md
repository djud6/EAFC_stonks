Futbin is a website that contains very helpful information about player cards for a game called EAFC. Information like player prices, player rating, trends etc. EAFC has a market where you can buy/sell players on the game, and I am very interested in taking advantage of that market. This code scrappes information from Futbin, information like player prices and player rating. 
I included additional code there to show the card with the lowest rating for each category and my logic behind that was to basically predict safe investments. For example, if a card is the lowest in a category then the only way is up, so you're not gonna loose any coins after buying said card.
